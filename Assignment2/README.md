## HTML, CSS, and JS

In this repository, we have prepared brief explanations of HTML, CSS, JS, and SVG. But you could also just look these up. 

You should start with `HTML.md`, then move to `CSS.md`. `SVG.md` describes SVG which we will use alot in this class. And `JS.md` introduces to Javascript in the browser.
