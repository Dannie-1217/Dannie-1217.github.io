### What is SVG?

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector image format for creating two-dimensional graphics using XML. Unlike raster images (like JPEG or PNG), which are made up of pixels, SVG images are based on mathematical equations. This means SVGs can be scaled to any size without losing quality, making them ideal for web design, logos, and icons.

SVG can be embedded directly into HTML, styled with CSS, and manipulated with JavaScript, making it highly flexible for dynamic and responsive designs.

### Most Important SVG Elements

Here are the most commonly used SVG elements:

#### 1. `<svg>`
The root element that contains all other SVG elements. It defines the space where the graphic will be drawn.

```html
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <!-- Other SVG elements go here -->
</svg>
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `width` and `height`: Define the size of the SVG canvas.

#### 2. `<rect>`
Used to draw rectangles and squares.

```html
<rect x="10" y="10" width="80" height="50" fill="blue" />
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `x`, `y`: The position of the top-left corner of the rectangle.
  - `width`, `height`: The dimensions of the rectangle.
  - `fill`: The color to fill the rectangle.

#### 3. `<circle>`
Used to draw circles.

```html
<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="30" fill="red" />
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `cx`, `cy`: The coordinates of the center of the circle.
  - `r`: The radius of the circle.
  - `fill`: The color to fill the circle.

#### 4. `<ellipse>`
Used to draw ellipses (ovals).

```html
<ellipse cx="50" cy="50" rx="30" ry="20" fill="green" />
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `cx`, `cy`: The coordinates of the center of the ellipse.
  - `rx`, `ry`: The x-axis and y-axis radii.
  - `fill`: The color to fill the ellipse.

#### 5. `<line>`
Used to draw straight lines between two points.

```html
<line x1="10" y1="10" x2="90" y2="90" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" />
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `x1`, `y1`: The coordinates of the start point.
  - `x2`, `y2`: The coordinates of the end point.
  - `stroke`: The color of the line.
  - `stroke-width`: The thickness of the line.

#### 6. `<polyline>`
Used to draw connected lines (a series of straight lines).

```html
<polyline points="10,10 40,40 70,10" fill="none" stroke="purple" />
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `points`: A list of points that define the polyline.
  - `fill`: The fill color (usually set to "none" if you only want the outline).
  - `stroke`: The color of the lines.

#### 7. `<polygon>`
Used to draw closed shapes with straight lines, like triangles, pentagons, and hexagons.

```html
<polygon points="50,15 90,85 10,85" fill="orange" />
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `points`: A list of points that define the corners of the polygon.
  - `fill`: The color to fill the shape.

#### 8. `<path>`
Used to draw complex shapes by defining a series of commands and points. This is one of the most versatile and powerful SVG elements.

```html
<path d="M10 10 H 90 V 90 H 10 Z" fill="lightblue" />
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `d`: A series of commands for drawing the path (e.g., `M` for move, `H` for horizontal line, `V` for vertical line, `Z` for closing the path).
  - `fill`: The color to fill the shape.

#### 9. `<text>`
Used to display text within the SVG.

```html
<text x="10" y="50" font-family="Verdana" font-size="24" fill="black">Hello, SVG!</text>
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `x`, `y`: The position of the text.
  - `font-family`: The font type.
  - `font-size`: The size of the text.
  - `fill`: The color of the text.

#### 10. `<g>`
Used to group SVG elements together. This is useful for applying transformations or styles to multiple elements at once.

```html
<g transform="translate(10, 20)">
  <rect width="50" height="50" fill="blue" />
  <circle cx="60" cy="60" r="20" fill="red" />
</g>
```

- **Attributes**:
  - `transform`: Applies transformations like translation, rotation, or scaling to the group.
